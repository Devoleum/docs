# Prerequisites to insert data into Devoleum

* The first prerequisite is to have a browser like **Google Chrome**, **Firefox** or **Brave**. On your smarthone you can use **Metamask Mobile**.
* The browser must have the **Metamask extension** installed, which allows you to interact with the blockchain, more details here: [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)

> A nice video tutorial about Metamask can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWfZnjkhhhg), remember to set it to the **Rinkeby network**.  

*Note: Metamask extension is only needed for data insertion. Everyone can read the data and explore histories with a simple browser from any device.*
