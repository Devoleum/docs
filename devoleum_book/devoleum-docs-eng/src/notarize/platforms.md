# Devoleum platforms

Go on [Devoleum.com](https://www.devoleum.com/) and chose to use the [Simulation](https://simulation.devoleum.com/) or the [Collaboration](https://collaborations.devoleum.com/Histories) platform. 

The **Collaboration platform** is used for official collaborations and needs a pre approval. 

**Devoleum** is composed by three main parts:

* Merchant profile
* Product history
* Supply chain’s step

The merchant can create a history about a product and add steps into it, following a hierarchy structure. 

### Example

* The merchant “Evoil” creates a profile on Devoleum simulation platform, in the profile section
* The merchant creates an history called “Evoil 2020” about the production of the EVOO bottles in the 2020
* The merchant add a step named “Harvest” in the history “Evoil 2020”
* The merchant add a step named “Transport” in the history “Evoil 2020”
* The merchant add a step named “Processing” in the history “Evoil 2020”
* And add steps to this history until the product is sold in a market

This process will result in a supply chain history on **Devoleum**:
