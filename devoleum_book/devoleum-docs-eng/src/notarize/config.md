# Configure Metamask

* Set **MetaMask network** to **Rinkeby**, Devoleum uses the Rinkeby test network, which does not use real cryptocurrencies but fictitious funds, because the purpose is to track the data without implying financial transactions, so no need to buy cryptocurrencies.
* To get funds on the **Rinkeby network**, simply use a faucet available at this link: [https://faucet.rinkeby.io/](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)
