# Storytelling

As it's possible to see in the example above, every single step allows you to build a page that tells the story of the product thanks to **Devoleum**. The story is shown by merging the JSON links notarized on the Ethereum blockchain by the merchant.

The **history of the product** with the blockchain notarization references can be shared via a **link** or **QR code**.

The final consumer is thus given the opportunity to easily consult the history of the product thanks to the use of a link or the scan of a QR code.
