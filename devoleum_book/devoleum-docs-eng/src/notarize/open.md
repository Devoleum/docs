# Open and Accessible

**Devoleum** is developed with **accessibility by design**, the history of the products can be access using from any mobile or desktop browser.

Furthermore, the **open source** nature of the project leaves infinite possibilities for creating support services and integration in third party sites (eg widgets on e-commerce, integration with robots / machinery for automated data entry) thanks to the use of the **Devoleum APIs** which they can also be created by Devoleum users.
